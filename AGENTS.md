## Mandatory rules

- Keep it very simple: Do not overengineer. Keep it bloody simple. Each file shall be perceivable, explainable and easily browsable
- DRY: Do not repeat yourself
- YAGNI: Avoid features apart from core behaviour
- Boy-scout rule: Always leave the campground cleaner as it was before! If tests fail, care about them! No matter if you touched them or not!
- Fail loud and early! Prevent fall-backs and silent failures
- Never skip tests!
- Strive for quality! Linting and testing have to pass!
